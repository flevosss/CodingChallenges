# CodingChallenges
I have created this Java program to provide a collection of coding challenges. 

It includes functions that test for different programming concepts such as palindrome, absolute difference, character count, 
longest increasing subsequence, and others. The user is prompted to input the challenge they wish to test and provide the required parameters. 

The program returns the solution to the challenge based on the input given.
